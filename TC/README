Before starting tests please set and export TET_ROOT_DIR variable.

It's highly recommened to add similar line at the end of your
 ~/.bashrc file:
export TET_ROOT_DIR=/full/path/to/tetware/dir

Example:
If user with login test placed TETware in it's home directory 
(/home/test/TETware contains tetware-simulator and tetware-target) 
it should add following line to .bashrc file:

export TET_ROOT_DIR=/home/test/TETware

and restart terminal.
